# Web Annotation Model

## Summary

Web annoations, put simply, are associations between two web resource. By providing an 
annotation for a resource, a connection is made, to another resource that may or may
not be host at the same host with the annotated resource. With these annotations users
can find relative resources by looking at annotations over the other.

Web Annotation Model is a standardized and very generalized way of storing annotations.
These storage method is specialised to be portable, and very extendable (meaning any
web resource can be either annotated or be an annotation). The storage systems that 
support this model also tend not to suffer from performance losses as they're specialized
to deal with complex graphs and huge datasets.

This model, however, does not provide the resources. These models really are "annotations"
in basic sense, It's user's or developers responsibility to provide access to these web 
resources.

The standard definition can be found here :https://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-model/

Above is a very simple graph that shows the generic structure of an annotation.

These different nodes, are as stated in the definition, are nodes in a graph and simply 
are linked to each other.
