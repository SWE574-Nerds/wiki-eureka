In this document, I'd like to simulate a user's steps in using this application. Basically user will use web interface and to the following: 

1. Create an account
1. Create a living history item
2. Start following living history items
1. Start creating annotations
1. After a while, view all annotations

---

1. Our user, (let's call him Archimedes), visits our website.

2. Archimedes sees that he needs to sign up to use the website.

3. Archimedes chooses a username, fills in the necessary information, and creates an account.

4. Since this is a new account, there's no activity to show Archimedes, currently.

5. So archimedes, creates a new item. He's really fond of "Tombili the Cat", so he wishes to create an item on him.

(WIP)

6. Having created the history item, he can view the history item now. By default, he starts following this page.

7. Now, another user, (let's call him CrazyCatLady) sees this page, and thinks she can contribute to this page, (because the statue in the picture is stolen!)

8. CrazyCatLady wants to add an annotation to the description, and contribute with the picture of the new statue.

9. Crazy Cat Lady selects the text, and immediately an annotation view pops up from the right-hand side.

10. She clicks submit, and the annotation is safe!

11. After a while, many people give out annotations on Tombili the Cat! And Archimedes is now a frequent user, having followed many items, his home page shows recent activities.

12. Archimedes sees that there's activity on his Living history item! So he want's to view it. He clicks the item, navigating to it's page.

13. There are annotations in his page. He can see the annotated parts are highlighted in yellow!

14. He wants to see the annotation on the picture, clearly showing the cat's pose. So he clicks the highlighted area in the picture, and sees the annotation.
