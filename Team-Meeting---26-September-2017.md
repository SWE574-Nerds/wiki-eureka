Discussions: 
1. We were pleased to welcome Ilker! We are going to add Ilker to all communication platforms that we use.
1. We've discussed about the feedbacks in the class, and what should be improved, what will be the next step.
1. It wasn't clear how to track issues according to last week's team experience. The main problem was that closing the issues. Should the owner of the issue close that specific issue or the last person who work on that? How can we decide whether they are completed or not? To prevent that confusion, it's decided that we are going to define acceptance criteria for all issues that we open. Each team member will be at the same page using this practice, and everyone in the team can close the issue if the work fits with acceptance criteria. 
1. It's decided to use eurekascrum as project management tool. It's discussed which workflow should we follow. Team is going to hold a daily scrum meeting. Meetings are going to be held in the Whatsapp group and around 19:00-19:30 CET+02:00 each day. Every week on Tuesday nights will be hold planning meeting.
1. It's decided to use craft.io(supports Gantt chart) as project management tool. Next step will be to work on project planning.
1. A person chosen during the meeting will take the meeting notes and add them to wiki.
