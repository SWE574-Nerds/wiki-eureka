##Â Eureka

Eureka is a project developed by SWE574-Nerds team and possible other contributors
for "SWE574-Software Development As A Team" class on Bogazici University, Software Engineering master program.


This project aims to crowdsource cultural heritage from people's own experiences.
Rather than seeking historical truth in every piece of information, this project
aims to let people provide whatever their knowledge is, even though conflicts 
with other people. The aim is to have a repository of cultural, historical 
source of knowledge on cultural heritage and also let others contribute.
